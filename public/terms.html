        <h2>1. NO LEGAL ADVICE (THE MOST IMPORTANT PART)</h2>
        <p>ZaHouse ("The Service") is an AI-powered strategic analysis tool. <strong>WE ARE NOT ATTORNEYS.</strong> The output provided by this system is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional legal counsel.</p>
        <p>By using this tool, you acknowledge that any decisions you make regarding contracts, royalties, or negotiations are your own responsibility. You agree to consult a qualified attorney before signing any binding agreements.</p>

        <h2>2. AI LIMITATIONS</h2>
        <p>This service uses artificial intelligence (Claude Sonnet 4.5) to analyze text. While highly advanced, AI can hallucinate, misinterpret context, or miss specific legal nuances. ZaHouse does not guarantee 100% accuracy of any analysis.</p>

        <h2>3. DATA PRIVACY</h2>
        <p>We respect your IP. Contracts uploaded to ZaHouse are processed for the purpose of analysis and are not sold to third-party record labels or data brokers. However, data is processed via third-party AI providers (Anthropic) to generate your results.</p>

        <h2>4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ZaHouse Music Group shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of this tool, including but not limited to lost royalties, missed opportunities, or bad deals signed.</p>
